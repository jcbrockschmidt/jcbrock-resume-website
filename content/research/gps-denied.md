Assisted in the development of a technique for navigating a fixed-wing unmanned aircraft system (i.e. "drone") in a GPS denied environment using a local radio positioning system. Contributions included establishing a live data stream from an off-site positioning system for remote testing, and working as part of the ground control operations team each week.

*Research was conducted at the Autonomous Flight Systems Laboratory under Dr. Christopher Lum.*
