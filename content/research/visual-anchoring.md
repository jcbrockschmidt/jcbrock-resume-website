Assisted in the development of a technique for orbiting a fixed-wing unmanned aircraft system (i.e. "drone") around a stationary target using visual input without the use of a GPS. Contributions included working as part of the ground control operations each week, as well as helping troubleshoot algorithmic problems related to visual tracking.

*Research was conducted at the Autonomous Flight Systems Laboratory under Dr. Christopher Lum as part of Ryan Grimes' Master's thesis.*
