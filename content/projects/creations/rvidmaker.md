Rvidmaker is an open source tool for scraping Reddit articles, rendering videos from their content, and posting these videos to YouTube. It utilizes both Reddit and YouTube's RESTful API services, and features a censor for filtering inappropriate content and avoiding demonitizable metadata. Titles, thumbnails, and metadata are generated automatically alongside videos.

This tool is deployed on a Linux server to periodically generate weekly video compilations for various subreddits. It can be viewed in action on it's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCijb0QQRc7GV1lxVnDzv8pw).
