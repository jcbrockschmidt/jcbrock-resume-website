Built an IP security camera from a Raspberry Pi model B with an IR camera module, which was fitted into a plastic housing. Video was streamed from the camera over RTSP to [ZoneMinder](https://www.zoneminder.com/)--a surveillance software system--hosted on a in-home Debian server. Live footage as well as previously recorded videos were streamed to my phone via the [ZmView](https://apkpure.com/zmview/com.html5clouds.zmview) app.
